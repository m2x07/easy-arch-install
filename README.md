# Easy Arch Install
A concise and detailed guide for effortless Arch Linux installation, offering a smooth installation journey

> **NOTE:** The author assumes that the reader has basic knowledge and overview of using the command line and working with the shell. if you are a complete beginner, then i would recommend avoiding Arch Linux and stick to some beginner friendly distro.

# 1. Initial Setup
## Connecting to Internet

<details>
    <summary>Wi-Fi</summary>
Start the daemons required:

```zsh
systemctl start iwd
systemctl start dhcpcd
```

Get interface name:
```zsh
ifconfig
```

Connecting to wi-fi.
```zsh
iwctl station <interface_name> connect "ssid"
```
> `ssid` is the name of the wi-fi network you want to connect to


Hit ENTER to enter your wifi password and confirm connection
</details>

<details>
    <summary>USB Tethering</summary>
1. Connect your phone to your computer using a USB Cable<br>
2. Navigate to Portable Hotspot (or look for similar settings) section and enable the USB tethering option<br>
3. Make sure your phone is connected to the internet and now your computer should have internet access<br>
</details>

### Test your internet connection
```zsh
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8       // ensure that DHCP is working
ping -c 3 archlinux.org // ensure that DNS is working
```
If your output for both the above command looks something like this, it means that you are getting responce from the server and you are connected to the internet
```zsh
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=113 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=114 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=117 time=73.5 ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2000ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 73.480/100.150/114.050/18.864 ms

```

# 2. Disk Configuration

## Getting disk information:
Run the command `fdisk -l` and you should see output similar to this:
```
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 476.94 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
Disk model: INTEL SSDPEKNU512GZ                     
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: C4F8B2FE-0074-4CC4-8445-F0C646127ACB
```
The "/dev/nvme0n1" in the first line is our disk we'll be working on. disk name may vary to something like "/dev/sda" or "/dev/sdb" or anything else. look for the disk that you want to install Arch Linux on and remember it or note it down somewhere<br>

## Partitioning:
There are various layouts and filesystems one can use to install Arch Linux
For this guide, we will be primarily using EXT4 filesystem
We will be using `cfdisk` tool to create our partitions. this tool is fairly easy to use as you can navigate through the options just by using the arrow keys.
```bash
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1     #replace disk name(nvme0n1) with your disk name
```
Delete any existing partions by following the on-screen option.<br>
Create 3 partions as follows:<br>

|Partition      | Size      | Filesystem|
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
|&lt;efi&gt;    | 1024M     | EFI System partition|
|&lt;swap&gt;    | same as your ram  | Linux Swap    |
|&lt;root&gt;    | remaining storage | Linux filesystem|

> **NOTE:** Minimum of 512M is recommended for efi partition. If you will be installing multiple kernels, use atleast 1024M for efi partition. We are not going to install multiple kernel in this guide but i'm still alloting 1024M.<br>

The order doesn't matter but this is what i prefer.<br>
Write and Quit.<br>
Let's run the `fdisk -l` command again and compare the output.<br>

```
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 476.94 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
Disk model: INTEL SSDPEKNU512GZ                     
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: C4F8B2FE-0074-4CC4-8445-F0C646127ACB

Device            Start        End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/nvme0n1p1     2048    2099199   2097152     1G EFI System
/dev/nvme0n1p2  2099200   35653631  33554432    16G Linux swap
/dev/nvme0n1p3 35653632 1000214527 964560896 459.9G Linux filesystem
```
As you can see, we can see information about our newly created partitions in the last 3 lines. Remember/Note down the device names for each partition.

## Formatting:
Let's format our partitions with appropriate filesystem<br>
Like i said, there are multiple filesystems available when it comes to partitioning and formatting, for this guide, we'll be covering ext4 as our primary filesystem
```bash
mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/<efi>       # FAT32 for the efi partition
mkfs.swap /dev/<swap>           # swap partition
mkfs.ext4 /dev/<root>           # EXT4 for the root partition
```
> As of now for BTRFS and other Filesystems, refer the friendly [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs)

## Mounting:
Mount all of the partitions:
```bash
mkdir /mnt/boot
mkdir /mnt/boot/efi             # Create an EFI mount point
mount /dev/<efi> /mnt/boot/efi  # mount the EFI partition
swapon /dev/<swap>              # enable the swap partition
mount /dev/<root> /mnt          # mount the root partition
```
If you get any errors, make sure you did the partitioning correctly. Create the same partitions again if necessary

# 3. Installing base system
Now its time to install the base system and kernel on our partitions<br>
Before we do so, let's make some changes to the config file of our package manager
```bash
nano /etc/pacman.conf           # or any text editor of your preference
```
Locate and un-comment the following lines:

`Color`<br>
`ParallelDownloads = 5`<br><br>
`[multilib]`<br>
`Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`<br>

For slower connections, you might want to change the ParallelDownloads to 3.<br>
Using the keybinds given on the bottom of the screen, Write the file and exit

Now lets install the packages and wait for the installation to finish
```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware vim nano
```
> **NOTE:** if you want to use any other kernel, then replace `linux` with your desired kernel. For example `linux-zen` or `linux-lts`. No need to replace the `linux-firmware` package<br>
Also, install `btrfs-progs` if you are using btrfs filesystem. it provides additional tools for btrfs filesystem   

Now finally generate the fstab configuration
```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

# 4. Chrooting
Till now we were working on our disk through the live environment.<br> 
Now we need to shift to our disk and do our thing there.<br>
```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

> **NOTE:** chrooting is the process of changing our root directory from live iso to the root of our disk where arch linux will be installed. make sure to not exit untill the installationi is finished as it may affect your installation. If you see the same commands, do not get confused as now we are in our new system and not the live iso

## Setting up the host
First we set the hostname in `/etc/hostname` file. A host name is like a nickname for your computer. you may take a moment to choose one for yourself, and remember it<br>
Once you've chosen, open up the file<br>
```bash
nano /etc/hostname
```
and just write your hostname here. Save and Quit<br>

Now we need to setup the `/etc/hosts` file.<br>
Use your desired editor to open the file `/etc/hosts`<br>

```bash
nano /etc/hosts
```
and APPEND the following lines in there:
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
127.0.0.1       <hostname>
```
In case you didn't guessed it yet, replace `<hostname>` with what you set in the `/etc/hostname` file.<br>
Write and Quit.<br>

## Configuring the Locale
Open the file `/etc/locale.gen` and un-comment your desired locale. For us, its `en_US.UTF-8`.<br>
Generate your locales based on the `locale.gen` file:
```bash
locale-gen
```
Set the locale in `/etc/locale.conf` file:
```bash
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```
Export the environment variable for the locale
```bash
export $(cat /etc/locale.conf)
```

## Installing necessary packages
Let's make some changes to the config file of our package manager
```bash
nano /etc/pacman.conf           # or any text editor of your preference
```
Locate and un-comment the following lines:

`Color`<br>
`ParallelDownloads = 5`<br><br>
`[multilib]`<br>
`Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`<br>

Feel free to change the value of ParallelDownloads.<br>
Install the packages using:
```bash
pacman -Syy sudo linux-headers efibootmgr grub amd-ucode git base-devel dkms avahi os-prober ntfs-3g
```
> **NOTE:** replace `amd-ucode` with `intel-ucode` for intel CPUs. <br> if you installed `linux-zen` kernel, then replace `linux-headers` with `linux-zen-headers`.<br>
include `grub-btrfs` package if you used btrfs filesystem

## Adding a new user
We haven't created our user yet and we will do it now.<br>
First let's change the password for the root user.
```bash
passwd
```
Let's add our user. Replace &lt;username&gt; with your desired username.
```bash
useradd -s /bin/bash -mG wheel <username>
```
Set the password for our new user
```bash
passwd <username>
```
Let's allow the group "wheel" to execute any commands with sudo
```bash
EDITOR=nano visudo
```
Locate and un-comment the following line:<br>
+ `%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`<br>

## Installing a bootloader (GRUB)
We will be installing GRUB for this guide<br>
If you wish to use any other bootloader, refer to the respective documentations.<br>
```bash
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id="Arch Linux" --efi-directory=/boot/efi --recheck
```
Open the file `/etc/default/grub` and un-comment the following line present at the end of the file:<br>
`GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false`<br>

Creating initial ramdisk
```bash
mkinitcpio -P
```
Generate the GRUB configuration file:<br>
```bash
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Installing a GUI (Desktop Environment OR Window Manager)
No sane person would like to use plain tty(you may use plain tty if you wish to). This guide covers several different Desktop Environment and Window Managers.<br>
This guide mainly focuses on KDE Plasma but if you wish to install any other, directly skip to [this section](https://github.com/m2x07/easy-arch-install#5-other-desktop-environments-and-window-managers)

### KDE Plasma:

Install the following packages:<br>
`pacman -S plasma plasma-wayland-session kde-applications sddm gnu-free-fonts noto-fonts noto-fonts-emoji packagekit-qt5 gnome-keyring cronie pipewire-media-session pipewire-jack phonon-qt5-vlc tesseract-data-ind python-pyqt5 xdg-desktop-portal-kde`<br>



You will be promped to choose which package to install couple of time. Simply go with default option. To do so, just hit ENTER each time you are asked.


Fix a sreen's color issue by removing a few packages (won't break your installtion):<br>
```bash
pacman -R colord colord-kde
```

Let's enable the NetworkManager, Login Manager and avahi daemon
```bash
systemctl enable NetworkManager sddm avahi-daemon
```

This will take a while, so sit back and wait for the installation to finish.<br>
KDE Plasma is now successfully installed<br><br>

Once the installation is done, its finally time to exit the chroot.
```bash
exit
```

Now that you are back in live iso, reboot your system:<br>
```bash
reboot now
```
Pull out the thumb drive with live iso once the screen turns off and before our computer turns back on.<br>
Once you see the login screen, make sure you have `Plasma (X11)` selected in the dropdown menu at top-left of the screen. Enter your password and login.<br>

# 5. Other Desktop Environments and Window Managers

Skip this step if you already installed KDE Plasma<br>
Click the individual items to expand them:<br>

<details>
<summary><b>GNOME</b></summary>

Install required packages and groups:

```bash
pacman -Su gnome gnome-extra gnome-tweaks gdm
```
Start the GDM service to use GNOME everytime you login

```bash
systemctl enable gdm.service
```

By Default, GNOME runs on Wayland and runs some native X11 apps using Xwayland.
While on the login screen, click the gear icon on the bottom of the screen to switch to Xorg and GNOME Classic<br>
Find more details [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME).<br>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>XFCE</b></summary>

Installation:<br>
```bash
pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies lightdm
```
Start the Display Manager service<br>
```bash
systemctl enable lightdm.service
```
Now you should be able to use XFCE4<br>
Find more details [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce).

</details>


# 6. Post Install Configuration


## Installing a helper for Arch User Repository (AUR)
You cannot miss on the AUR. to get packages from AUR, you need an AUR Helper<br>
There are [many AUR helpers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) available. We will be installing YAY.
Follow the commands below one by one:
```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./yay-git
cd yay-git
makepkg -si
```
Enter your password whenever prompted and hit ENTER whenever prompted<br>
Now you can install packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR) just like you do in pacman:<br>
Example: <br>
```bash
yay -S package_name         # install a package
yay -Ss <search_keyword>    # search for a package
```

## Installing NVIDIA Drivers for linux

> This doesn't covers all the details for all NVIDIA cards. The steps shown here should work for most of the latest NVIDIA GPUs. 

### Installing necessary packages

First of all, make sure you have these packages installed:
`base-devel`, `linux-headers` and `git`.<br>
If you don't have any of these packages, please install them first

Next step is to find out your card's code name [from this list](https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/CodeNames.html).<br>
Find your card from the list and remember/note down its codename as different cards needs different drivers.<br>
Carefully refer to the above list and then proceed down further this guide, it might be confusing at first<br>

* For `NV110` series and newer (should work for almost every newer cards):

```bash
yay -S nvidia nvidia-utils nvidia-settings nvtop lib32-nvidia-utils opencl-nvidia lib32-opencl-nvidia
```

> replace `nvidia` with `nvidia-lts` if you installed `linux-lts` kernel. `nvidia-dkms` for any other kernel.



* For `NVCx`* and `NVDx`* cards:

> *where 'x' is any letter/number

```bash
yay -S nvidia-settings nvidia-390xx-dkms nvidia-390xx-utils lib32-nvidia-390xx-utils opencl-nvidia-390xx lib32-opencl-nvidia-390xx
```

* For `NVE0` family:

```bash
yay -S nvidia-settings nvidia-470xx-dkms nvidia-470xx-utils lib32-nvidia-470xx-utils opencl-nvidia-470xx lib32-opencl-nvidia-470xx
```

> **NOTE:** This is just examples of most common used drivers.<br> For more information, refer [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) page on Arch Wiki.

### Enable the DRM Kernel mode settings

Open the grub config file(/etc/default/grub) using your preffered text editor (sudo required).<br>
Find the line with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` and append `nvidia-drm.modeset-1` to it.<br>
Save and Exit the file.<br>
Finish off with:
```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
Open up the mkinitcpio config file(/etc/mkinitcpio.conf) the same way.<br>
Find the line with `MODULES=()`. This brackets doesn't have to be empty.<br>
Append the following into the brackets:
`nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm`<br>
Save and Exit.<br>
Finish off with `sudo mkinitcpio -P`.<br>

### Add the pacman hook

Every time the NVIDIA driver updates, you need to update the initramfs as well. this step takes away that hassle from you by using a [pacman hook](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Hooks).<br>

Create a new empty file: `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/nvidia.hook`<br>
You can do that either by using the `touch` command or just directly opening it using your preffered editor as if it already exists. First save will automatically create the file

Put the following content into the `nvidia.hook` file:<br>
```
[Trigger]
Operation=Install
Operation=Upgrade
Operation=Remove
Type=Package
Target=nvidia
Target=linux
# Change the linux part above if a different kernel is used

[Action]
Description=Update NVIDIA module in initcpio
Depends=mkinitcpio
When=PostTransaction
NeedsTargets
Exec=/bin/sh -c 'while read -r trg; do case $trg in linux*) exit 0; esac; done; /usr/bin/mkinitcpio -P'
```

> **NOTE:** Replace both the values for "Target" according to what you installed. for example, `nvidia-lts` and `linux-lts` if you have `linux-lts` kernel and same goes if you have `nvidia-dkms`.<br>

The complication in the Exec line above is in order to avoid running mkinitcpio multiple times if both nvidia and linux get updated. In case this does not bother you, the Target=linux and NeedsTargets lines may be dropped, and the Exec line may be reduced to simply Exec=/usr/bin/mkinitcpio -P<br>

Now reboot and enjoy :)

### Checking if the drivers are actually installed.

Run the command: `nvidia-smi`<br>
This should show your GPU name and some other information in the output.

> For more information on Hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding and few other NVIDIA-related topics, refer to [this page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) on ArchWiki, or forums or try googling.
